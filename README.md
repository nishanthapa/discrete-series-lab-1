This is a discrete series lab 1.
The questions are:
1. Write a program that takes two or more sets as input and produces set
operations like union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference as
its output.
2. Write a program that takes two or more sets as input and produces their
Cartesian product as output.
3. Write a program that takes a real number and produces is ceiling and floor
integers as output.
4. Write a program that takes name and age of a 5 persons as an input and
gives the degree of membership of the person as its output according to
following membership functions.
a. Degree of membership = 1 if age<=20
Degree of membership = (30-age)/10 if age>20 and age<=30
Degree of membership = 0 if age>30
b. Degree of membership = 1 if age<=15
Degree of membership = (35-age)/20 if age>15 and age<=35
Degree of membership = 0 if age>35
Perform set operations according to rules of fuzzy sets, on these
two sets.
